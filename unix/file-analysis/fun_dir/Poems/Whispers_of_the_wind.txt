Whispers of the wind through the trees,
Nature's gentle lullaby on the breeze.
Leaves rustle, a soft melody,
A serenade from the green canopy.

Mountains stand tall, silent and grand,
Their peaks touching the sky, a distant land.
Rivers weave tales as they gently flow,
Nature's poetry in a rhythmic glow.

Sunset paints the canvas in hues,
A masterpiece of oranges, reds, and blues.
Stars emerge, a celestial dance,
A night's romance, a mystic trance.

In the quiet of nature, secrets untold,
A symphony of life, stories unfold.
Listen closely, and you will find,
The world's poetry in the whispers of the wind.
