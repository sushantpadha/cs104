Beneath the moonlit sky so clear,
Dreams unfold, drawing near.
Silver beams dance on the lake,
A tranquil night, no hearts to break.

Stars like diamonds in the night,
Guiding souls in gentle light.
The world sleeps, in shadows cast,
Moonlit dreams, enchanting, vast.

Owls hoot in the quietude,
Nature's lullaby, soft and shrewd.
Whispers of night, a soothing tune,
Underneath the velvet moon.

In the silence, dreams take flight,
Embraced by the soft, silvery light.
Moonlit dreams, a celestial stream,
Guiding hearts in a tranquil gleam.
